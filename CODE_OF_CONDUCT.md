All principles of the [37 Signals](https://37signals.com) that aren't specific to profit.

The following subset of Tom Sachs' [Ten Bullets](https://medium.com/@terencelbraschiii/a-brief-introduction-to-tom-sachs-10-bullets-6a0a58077777), adapted for software development:
- Bullet 1 is fundamentally incompatible with software development. If you read it, do exactly the opposite of what it suggests.
- Bullet 2: "Sacred Space." Give everyone what they need to succeed. Get out of their way, and let nothing and no one get in their way.
- Bullet 3: "Be on Time." This has nothing to do with clocks. Outside of work, do other stuff. Take vacations. Take care of yourself. That way, when you log in, you will be ready.
- Bullet 4: "Thoroughness Counts." Do not save one hour today at the expense of 500 hours in six months. _That ratio is **not** hyperbole._
- Bullet 5: "I Understand." Good software is not written without understanding the use cases that it must support.
- Bullet 6: "Sent Does Not Mean Received." Do not allow code reviews to remain stale, whether yours or someone else's.
- Bullet 8: "Always Be Knolling." Do not ship code without tests. Do not write production code before tests unless you're exploring an unfamiliar solution space. Let there be no `Dockerfile` that doesn't run unit tests. `Dockerfile`s should fail to build if any of the tests don't pass.
- Bullet 9: "Sacrifice to Leatherface." It is by well-used failure that success is obtained. **Do NOT waste a mistake.**
- Bullet 10: "Persistence." — "Nothing in the world can take place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent." — Ray Kroc, Founder of McDonalds.
